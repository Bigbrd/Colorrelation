Features/thoughts:

-Make ML server and plug in the functions

- Make the chart really cool and styled
- Clean up the rest of the website and add polish (I like the examples of: http://materialuicolors.co/
http://actionpotential.jeremyrgordon.com/app/public
)
- typescript? how to migrate over? am I missing any technologies here before getting deeper?
- facebook/twitter like buttons.
- google analytics
- google fonts/material ui?
- ask gender and age!
- ability to reset
- scale the size of the circle like 1/100 of the amount already selected.



Future:
- integrate with azure storage
- telemetry for each user, click, color selections, etc. that is getting stored.
- pipe telemetry back into other users so that every user can see every other users favorite colors
- pipe telemetry into azureml to get some correlations and clustering
- add questions for further clustering? 
- add email contact & CTA that we want visitors to go do "like this? follow us on twitter + subscribe for other cool correlation projects"
