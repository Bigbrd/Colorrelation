Features/thoughts:

- Get the click to render a bubble on the scatter plot
- Make the chart really cool and styled
- Clean up the rest of the website and add polish (I like the examples of: )
- typescript? how to migrate over? am I missing any technologies here before getting deeper?


Future:
-integrate with azure storage
- telemetry for each user, click, color selections, etc. that is getting stored.
- pipe telemetry back into other users so that every user can see every other users favorite colors
- pipe telemetry into azureml to get some correlations and clustering
-add questions for further clustering? 
- add email contact & CTA that we want visitors to go do "like this? follow us on twitter + subscribe for other cool correlation projects"
